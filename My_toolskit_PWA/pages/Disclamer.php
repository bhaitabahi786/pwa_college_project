      <h5 id="info-modal-content" class="center-on-small-only">So What is PWA</h5>
      <hr>
      <p class="justify">A progressive web application (PWA), commonly known as a progressive web app, is a type of
        application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, and WebAssembly. It is intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser,
        including both desktop and mobile devices.</p>
      <p>Since a progressive web app is a type of webpage or website known as a web application, they do not require
        separate bundling or distribution. Developers can just publish the web application online, ensure that it
        meets baseline "installability requirements", and users will be able to add the application to their home
        screen.Publishing the app to digital distribution systems like Apple App Store or Google Play is optional</p>
